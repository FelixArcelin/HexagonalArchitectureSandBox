# Motivation

This repository allows me to understand what port and adapters architecture is using NestJS. It might be overkill to use port and adapters architecture for such a simple project but I find it fun to do it :)

I chose Nest.js because it provides multiples solutions for modularity, security, Inversion of control and many other things. I implemented CQS Principle because its fun.
